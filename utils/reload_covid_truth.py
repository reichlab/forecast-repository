    """
    Reloads all COVID-19 zoltar project truth versions using git revisions of zoltar-truth.csv. Required due to the bug
    [loading truth validates Unit.name instead of Unit.abbreviation #333](https://github.com/reichlab/forecast-repository/issues/333).
    We think the missing truth is all batches after 2021-10-18 to now (2022-03-29). Recall from `truth_batches`() that
    batches are identified by the oracle model's `(source, issued_at)` key. Instead of deleting and reloading those
    batches, this app instead reloads them all going back to the first revision available.

    Note: I determined which timezeros were missing by querying for Texas - a convenient state to use:
        SELECT *
        FROM forecast_app_predictionelement AS pe
                 JOIN forecast_app_forecast AS f ON pe.forecast_id = f.id
                 JOIN forecast_app_timezero AS tz ON f.time_zero_id = tz.id
        WHERE pe.unit_id = 379           -- TX
          AND pe.target_id = 1901        -- 1 wk ahead inc death
          AND f.forecast_model_id = 464  -- oracle
          AND tz.timezero_date >= '2021-10-19';

    Experimenting with different timezero_date and unit_id values in the b079 database resulted in these # rows:
        tz date      TX   US
              none:  500  4606
